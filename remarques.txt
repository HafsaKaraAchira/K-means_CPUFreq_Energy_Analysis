phase 1 :
    readpoints from file
    
phase 2 :
    intitialize centers
    
phase 3 :
    input checks
    points-centers distance matrix calculation
    clusters population count
    calculate each cluster mean and sum
    calculate each point energy (error square)
    weight the point energy

phase 4 :
    loop : while there is points swap
        for each point ( 
                for each cluster (
                    calculate point - center distance 
                    compare with old distance
                    update the two clusters infos if new min distance
                )   
            )

phase 5 :
    compute clusters energy

phase 6 :
    save points clusters and centers infos in files

* phase 7 :
    calculate variance and clusters summary
